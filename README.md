#Kafka-Powered Notification Service
This project implements a high-performance notification service that processes over 2,000 events per second using Apache Kafka for distributed messaging, Dockerized consumers, and Terraform-managed AWS EC2 auto-scaling groups for dynamic scalability. The notification service is built with Flask, a Python web framework.

Features
Real-time Event Processing: Processes 2,000+ events per second using Kafka.
Scalable Architecture: Uses Docker to containerize services and Terraform for auto-scaling on AWS EC2.
Flask-based API: A simple REST API to trigger and process notifications.
Distributed System: Uses Kafka for message brokering and multiple consumers to process notifications in parallel.
Technologies Used
Apache Kafka: A distributed streaming platform for handling high-throughput, low-latency messaging.
Docker: For containerization of services (producers, consumers).
Terraform: For managing AWS infrastructure (EC2 instances and auto-scaling groups).
AWS EC2: For running the services in a scalable cloud environment.
Flask: A lightweight Python web framework used to build the API.
Python: Programming language for writing the notification service logic.
Kafka Python: Kafka client library for Python.
Setup and Installation
Prerequisites
Before setting up the project, make sure you have the following installed:

Docker: For containerizing the consumer services.
Terraform: For managing AWS infrastructure.
Python 3.x: For running Flask and Kafka Python consumers.
Kafka: You can use a local Kafka broker or set up one on AWS.
AWS CLI: To interact with AWS for infrastructure management.
Installation Steps
Clone the Repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/Kafka-Powered-Notification-Service.git
cd Kafka-Powered-Notification-Service

Set Up Kafka:

You can either run Kafka locally using Docker or connect to an existing Kafka cluster.
For local setup, you can use a pre-built Docker image to start Kafka and Zookeeper: docker-compose up -d
Dockerize the Consumers:

Build the Docker images for your Kafka consumers. docker build -t kafka-consumer .
Terraform Setup (for AWS EC2 and Auto-scaling):

Set up your AWS credentials and run the following Terraform commands to initialize and apply the infrastructure: terraform init
terraform apply
Running the Flask API:

Install the necessary Python dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the Flask API: flask run

This will start the API server, and you can trigger notifications via HTTP requests.

Start the Kafka Producers and Consumers:

Start your Kafka producers that will generate events to be processed.
Run your Kafka consumer services that will consume the messages and trigger notifications.
API Documentation
POST /send-notification
Sends a notification event to Kafka.

Request body:

{ "user_id": "12345", "message": "You have a new notification!" }

Response:

{ "status": "Notification sent" }

AWS Setup
This project uses Terraform to manage AWS infrastructure for EC2 instances and auto-scaling groups.

Steps:
Configure AWS credentials.
Modify the terraform/variables.tf file to include your AWS region and instance details.
Run Terraform commands to create resources: terraform init
terraform apply
Docker Setup
Docker is used to containerize the Kafka consumers. Follow these steps to build and run the consumer containers.

Build Docker Image: docker build -t kafka-consumer .

Run Consumer Containers: docker run -d kafka-consumer
